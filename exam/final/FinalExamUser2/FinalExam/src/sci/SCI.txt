Write a short essay discussing the relationship between an SCI principle
of your choosing and a Computer Science principle that is relevant for
this MPP course. Richer content will be awarded more credit.


 SCI and Modern Programming Practises are quite much similar in many ways. The five main principles of SCI are as follows:

 1. Growth
 2. Stability
 3. Purification
 4. Integration
 5. Adaptibility

 We will describe further the MPP with regards to the points above.

 1. Growth: The nature of life is to grow. So, is the software. If software are well maintained and code can be separated into proper
 modules and a good abstraction can be used which helps for the growth and maintainability of modern softwares. The courses goes through
 many advanced concept which helps in maintaining a big software.

 2. Stability: Life need to be stable in order to be achieve the goals and success. Thus, stability is a must not just in the life but also in
 software. The software is stable only if the code are properly unit tested and the programmer understand the basics behind how apis of
 the language and how compiler can be a friend. The course provided me with the capabilities to write proper unit tested code.

 3. Purification: As in life, purification is and an essential part of the software development. The software have bugs in them, the old apis
 deprecate and new way of writing the software evolve with time.

 4. Integration: Similar to what we are taught in the SCI course, integration is one of the most essential part of writing the software. Many modules and packages
 of softwares are integrated to create a bigger applications.

 5. Adaptability: Adaptability is as essential in the software, since growing software demands changes to the api, packages and ofcourse with new
 api and design requirement, the software need to adapt to the changes.


 Thus, software and MPP courses in particular is quite related to all the principles of the SCI.
